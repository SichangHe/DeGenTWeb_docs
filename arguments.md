(citation in Quarto format w/ `reference.bib` for future writing)

## Crawling

- trying to see webpage users see although scraper see different results,
    search result differ based on location
- main body text extraction is difficult to do well, but
    we do best-effort w/ SoTA method
    - Trafilatura [@barbaresi2021trafilatura]
        is SoTA [@bevendorff2023empirical; reeve2024evaluation]

## Generated text detection

- Binoculars score reflect information density (substance)
    - is calibrated perplexity
    - generated text is bad because provide less actual information
    - detect both generated and low-quality content

## Content farm

- moral issue: some site like GeeksforGeeks look like content farm but
    may be useful; what is our stance?
