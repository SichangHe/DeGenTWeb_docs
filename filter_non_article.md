# Filter out Non-Article

Binoculars, and presumably other generated text detectors,
can only perform well when detecting articles such as blog posts.
Non-articles, include lists of links on a homepage, login pages, dashboards of
sports scores, and spec charts of products,
may cause high false positive rates.

Current method to filter out non-articles (`visit_subdomains.py`):

- use how-to search results.
    most of them are articles and forum threads, except for
    occasional product sales page
- discard pages w/ \< 200 tokens
- discard pages w/ \> 20% text in link/code
    - Trafilatura sometimes extract wrong thing
        - extract many link following main text, e.g.
            <https://entrance-exam.net/annamalai-university-pg-diploma-in-automobile-maintenance-auto-garage-management-papers/>
        - extract only code block, e.g.
            for <https://plaid.com/institutions/mos/>
    - ⇒ try Trafilatura w/ `favor_precision` instead of `favor_recall` if
        too much text in link/code
- discard pages w/o any "block" \> 250 characters long
    - a block is a paragraph, list item, or
        other non-container HTML element text
    - likely not consist of paragraph
- discard pages w/ \< 20% text in "large blocks"
    - large block need ≥100 characters
- discard pages w/ \> 40% text in list/table
- discard pages w/ \> 50% text duplicated relative to previous pages of
    the same subdomain
    - calculate %duplication based on byte chunks from
        Rabin fingerprint content-defined chunking (CDC)
        - 32 byte window, 96 byte target block size (1/64 probability for
            splitting)

Ideas for filtering:

- discard pages based on HTML structure
    - but HTML structure is extremely flexible and
        behave differently based on CSS
    - perhaps study how Trafilatura filter out non-main-body text
- feed extracted text to classifier
    - BERT-based classifier for article/non-article

Unreliable ideas:

- filter by `og:type` = `article`.
    unreliable because not every article has this tag and
    content farm may have this tag be `website`

## Deduplication

    System](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/sf94/full_papers/manber.finding),
    Udi Manber, USENIX Winter, 1994
    - use Rabin fingerprint (polynomial fingerprint) to
        randomly determine "anchor" for chunking
        - polynomial fingerprint bc can efficiently compute next n-byte hash
            after shifting 1 byte
    - find identical chunks
- Simhash

## Segmentation for generalization

Instead of only filtering out what we cannot handle (non-article),
we can also try to generalize our method to *all* webpages.

If we could split a webpage into sections, we could apply Binoculars to
each section.
For example, we could segment a homepage full of links into each of
the links it contains, and subsequently filter them out based on length;
we could segment a forum page into each comment.

Importantly, we need to segment after main text extraction with Trafilatura.
